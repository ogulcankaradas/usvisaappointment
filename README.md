# usvisaappointment
VisaVIA Telegram Bot This is an automated script that checks the available visa appointment dates on a specific website. The script logs into the website, navigates to the appointment page, and checks the available dates before a specified target date. When a valid appointment date is found, the bot sends a notification via Telegram.

Features Login Automation: The bot logs into the website using the provided credentials. Appointment Availability Check: The bot checks the available visa appointment dates on the website. Telegram Notifications: When an available appointment date is found, a message is sent to the specified Telegram chat. Scheduled Checks: The bot checks appointments at random intervals to avoid overloading the site. Cross-Browser Support: The script uses the Brave browser (configured with the binary_location option), but it can easily be adapted to other browsers like Chrome.

Requirements Python: Python 3.7 or higher. Libraries: Install the required Python libraries using cmd -- pip install requests selenium WebDriver: Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver). You can get the WebDriver. Telegram Bot: Create a Telegram bot and get its API Token and your Chat ID. You can create a bot using BotFather.

Setup Create a Telegram Bot: Create a new bot using BotFather. Copy your API Token and Chat ID.

Script Configuration: Replace YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_API_TOKEN and YOUR_CHAT_ID in the script with your own values. Update the path to the browser and WebDriver. Set the target date in the target_date variable.

Target Date: Enter the date before which you want to find an available appointment in the target_date variable.

Running the Script After configuring the bot, you can run the script with: python visaviatelegram.py

Notes Security: The bot waits for a random time between 10 to 15 minutes between each check to avoid being blocked by the website. Error Handling: If the bot encounters an error, it will log the error and close the browser after each check.

Disclaimer This script interacts with a third-party website and should be used responsibly. Ensure that you comply with the terms of service of the website you are interacting with, to avoid any violations or account bans.

Have a good luck on your visa interview...
